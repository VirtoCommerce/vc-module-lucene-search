# VirtoCommerce.LuceneSearch
VirtoCommerce.LuceneSearch module implements ISearchProvider defined in the VirtoCommerce.Core module and uses Lucene search engine which stores indexed documents in a local file system.

# Installation
Installing the module:
* Automatically: in VC Manager go to **Modules > Available**, select the **Lucene Search module** and click **Install**.
* Manually: download module ZIP package from https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-lucene-search/releases. In VC Manager go to **Modules > Advanced**, upload module package and click **Install**.

# Configuration
## VirtoCommerce.Search.SearchConnectionString
The search configuration string is a text string consisting of name/value pairs seaprated by semicolon (;). Name and value are separated by equal sign (=).
For Lucene provider the configuration string must have three parameters:
```
provider=Lucene;server=~/App_Data/Lucene;scope=default
```
* **provider** should be **Lucene**
* **DataDirectoryPath** (or **server** for compatibility with VirtoCommerce.Search module which is now obsolete) is a virtual or physical path to the root directory where indexed documents are stored.
* **scope** is a common name for each index. In fact, this is the prefix for the name of a subdirectory inside the root directory which will contain indexed documents. So the directory structure will be like this: 
```
DataDirectoryPath
    scope-DocumentType1
    scope-DocumentType2
```

You can configure the search configuration string either in the VC Manager UI or in VC Manager web.config. Web.config has higher priority.
* VC Manager: **Settings > Search > General > Search configuration string**
* web.config: **connectionStrings > SearchConnectionString**:
```
<connectionStrings>
    <add name="SearchConnectionString" connectionString="provider=Lucene;server=~/App_Data/Lucene;scope=default" />
</connectionStrings>
```

# Known issues
* Sorting by geo distance (`GeoDistanceSortingField`) is not supported
